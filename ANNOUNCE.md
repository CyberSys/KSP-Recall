## ANNOUNCE

TBD

— — — — —

This Release will be published using the following Schedule:

* GitHub, reaching first manual installers and users of KSP-AVC. Right now.
* CurseForge, by Friday night
* SpaceDock (and CKAN users), by Saturday night.

The reasoning is to gradually distribute the Release to easily monitor the deployment and cope with eventual mishaps.
