## ANNOUNCE

This appears that this stunt is still working fine, after all! :D

[KSP Recall 0.0.3.1](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall/releases) is available for the brave Kerbonauts willing to risk their SAS with these stunts.

This release fixes an Editor glitch that resets the amount of a Resource when cloning the part. Now, the resource's amounts are preserved! ;)

Exercise prudence - this thing is still not completely tested with Fuel Switches. Use S.A.V.E. just in case.

Good Luck!

This Release will be published using the following Schedule:

* GitHub, reaching first manual installers and users of KSP-AVC. Right now.
* CurseForge, by Thusday night
* SpaceDock (and CKAN users), by Friday night.

The reasoning is to gradually distribute the Release to easily monitor the deployment and cope with eventual mishaps.
