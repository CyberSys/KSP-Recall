## ANNOUNCE

We are now in Release status! :) It appears that this stunt is work fine, after all! :D

[KSP Recall 0.0.3.0](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall/releases) is available for the brave Kerbonauts willing to risk their SAS with these stunts.

Exercise prudence - this thing is still not completely tested with Fuel Switches. Use S.A.V.E. just in case.

Good Luck!

This Release will be published using the following Schedule:

* GitHub, reaching first manual installers and users of KSP-AVC. Right now.
* CurseForge, by Friday night
* SpaceDock (and CKAN users), by Saturday night.

The reasoning is to gradually distribute the Release to easily monitor the deployment and cope with eventual mishaps.
