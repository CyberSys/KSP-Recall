# KSP-Recall :: Changes

* 2020-0817: 0.0.4.1 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.8.0
	+ An error on handling parts without `RigidBody` was raining NREs on the KSP.log. Fixed.
	+ A slightly smarter handling of inactive and rigidbodyless parts may save a tiny little bit of CPU time.
	+ Specialised treatment for Kerbals on EVA, as it was realised that Kerbals drifts a lot more than crafts - by reasons still unknown at this moment.
* 2020-0815: 0.0.4.0 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.8.0
	+ Adds a Work Around for crafts drifting on the Heading at rest, even when without wheels attached.
		- There's another similar problem on the wheels themselves, KSP Recall are still working on this one
	+ **Way** smarter selective applying of the Modules when needed.
