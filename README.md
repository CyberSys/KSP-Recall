## Description

Tired of constantly updating your Add'Ons each time a new KSP release fsck up something?

Restless while waiting your favorite Add'On to be updated so you can play without invoking devils on dark and incompreensible rituals?

So this Add'On is for you.

By installing this thingy, unsolved bugs and mishaops from KSP Development Team will be fixed or at least workarounded, saving Add'On Authors from the hassle to handle them themselves.

It aims to need minimal coupling with existent code, as well to be selectively injected on the broken parts in order to prevent *unholly intercations with third-party modules* that decide to fix things their own way.

Currently, the following fixes are available once installed:

* TweakScale:
	+ KSP 1.9.x resets resources to prefab while cloning parts [#96](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/96)
* More to come! 


## Installation

Detailed installation instructions are now on its own file (see the [In a Hurry](#in-a-hurry) section) and on the distribution file.
