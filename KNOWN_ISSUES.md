# KSP-Recall :: Known Issues

*  Wheels and Landing Legs **also** drifts, but due different reasons - so, in fact, we have **two** sources of drifting on KSP >= 1.8 right now. The present Recall version does not (yet) fixes the wheels' drift (besides helping a very little bit, as there's one less source of drifting now).
* Adjusting the *Maximum Physics Delta-Time Per Frame* to 0.03 gave some marginal positive results on the crafts on my i7 MacPotato, but the Kerbals drifted sensibly more. Given the randomness of the amount of drifting we get on every game restart, take this information with a huge grain of salt.
* KSP-Recall *WORKS FINE WITH* Module Manager.
